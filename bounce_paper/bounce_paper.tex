We present a collection of bouncing microbursts observed by the HILT instrument on SAMPEX from 1994-2004.
The statistical properties of these microbursts are analyzed, and an estimate of their scale sizes are obtained. 
We find that that the majority of bouncing microbursts observed by SAMPEX have scale sizes on the order of $10^2km$.

\section{Introduction}
Radiation belt electron populations are determined by a variety of source and loss processes. 
An important loss process is pitch angle scattering of electrons by plasma waves, which depletes the radiation belts by losing electrons to the atmosphere. 
Whistler mode chorus waves in particular scatter electrons into microbursts, which are short ($<100$ms) increases in precipitating electron flux. 

Microbursts were first observed in the form of Bremsstrahlung x-rays by balloon borne detectors \cite{balloon_burst_first} in year.
Modleing has shown that microbursts are potentially an important loss process, capable of emptying the radiation belts on the order of a day \cite{micro_loss} (what does this actually mean)
An important parameter in determining the importance of microbursts as a loss process is their scale size. 
Estimates from various papers
 

Microbursts are sometimes observed in trains that descend in amplitude.
These are known as ``bouncing microbursts'' as they appear to be the same packet of electrons being observed multiple times as they bounce between their mirror points \cite{Blake96}. 
They are characterized in time series data by several microbursts separated by one bounce period, each decreasing in amplitude as more electrons are lost to the atmosphere on each bounce.
The time between each microburst could also be half a bounce period, if two microbursts are generated from the same event and are launched northward and southward.  

Bouncing microbursts offer a unique opportunity to measure properties of the microburst. 
Repeated observations of the same microburst allow us to estimate the particle's scale size, and do other things i suppose
Bouncing microbursts have been observed by SAMPEX \cite{Blake96} and the FIREBIRD-II cubesats \cite{fire_bounce}, from which estimates of the scale size of the microbursts were obtained. 

A collection of bouncing microbursts would be useful to estimate a distribution of scale sizes for microbursts as a whole, rather than a scattering of estimates from individual microbursts.




\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{case_study.png}
\caption{A series of bouncing microbursts in succession. The time between peaks is labeled in units of the bounce period for $1$MeV electrons. }
\end{figure}

 
\section{Bouncing Microburst Algorithm}
To search for bouncing microbursts in the $20$ms SAMPEX data, we construct a correlation based algorithm. %bad
We construct several ``kernels'', which are artificial data designed to look like bouncing microbursts. 
These kernels are constructed of Gaussians with various separations ranging from $.05$s to $1$s to attempt to capture bouncing microbursts with a variety of bounce periods. 
We then take the cross correlation of the SAMPEX time series data and each of the kernels, and flag places with high correlation for manual review. 
We also require that each flagged location contain a microburst as defined by the O'Brien parameter \cite{obrien_parameter}. 

The algorithm initially identified 7107 candidates, which were narrowed down to 892 bouncing microbursts by hand. 
Improvements could be made to the algorithm, as it has an extremely high false positive rate. 

\section{Location}
With this collection of bonucing microbursts, the statistical properties of these events can be studied. 
The majority of these events occur in two bands, between L shells $2$ and $4$, with a smaller population at $L>6$. 
The occurrence characteristics of microbursts in SAMPEX data have been studied \cite{burst_occurrence} and microbursts are most frequent between $L=4$ and $L=6$; however, the bouncing microbursts found in this study are least likely to occur in this band. 
This discrepancy could be cause by the sheer number of microbursts making it difficult to pick out bouncing microbursts; any unrelated microburst occuring in the middle of an observation of a bouincing microburst will mean that bouncing microburst will be rejected, possibly artificially deflating the frequency of observations in the band where microbursts are most likely to occur. 
Most bouncing microbursts in this study occur in the morning sector between $0$ and $12$ magnetic local time, which aligns with the occurrence characteristics of microbursts in general as found by \citeA{burst_occurrence}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dial.png}
\caption{Locations of bouncing microbursts in L and MLT. Color scale indicates average distance between peaks in units of the bounce period of $1$MeV electrons at the edge of the loss cone.  }
\end{figure}

\section{Bounce Period Distribution}
One may expect that the time between peaks in a bouncing microburst would be one bounce period, or half of a bounce period if two microbursts are launched from their source region moving in opposite directions. 
However, the distribution of time differences between peaks in units of bounce periods has peaks not at $.5$ and $1$, but at approximately $.7$ and $1.7$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:periods}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{period_hist_1_MeV.png}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{period_hist_60_keV.png}
\label{fig:periods}
\caption{Distribution of time between peaks measured in bounce periods. Fig a) shows the distribution calculated for 1MeV electrons mirroring at 100km, and fig b) shows the distribution calculated for 60 keV electrons mirroring at 30deg mlat.}
\end{figure} 

Thus far we have assumed that each peak in a bonucing microburst corresponds to the same microburst bouncing between mirror points, or to two microbursts generated in the same region simultaneously.
The data however suggest that a substantial number of the collected events are not made of microbursts generated from a single event.

Whistler mode chorus often occur in groups of short discrete elements. 
There are several parameters used to characterize whistler mode chorus, including their repetition rate \cite{repetition_rate}.  
Microbursts are often associated with chorus waves, and repetitive wave-particle interaction between chorus and electrons (at the equator?) could produce ``bouncing'' microbursts with time scales defined by the chorus repetition rate and not the bounce period of the electrons in the microburst. 

\cite{repetition_rate} studied whistler mode chorus waves in $L>5$ and their repetition rates. 

**********
how to compare my data with theirs? most samples are $L<5$ 
******
\section{Scale Sizes}
Measurements of bouncing microbursts allow us to compute the local scale size of the microburst, and from that the equatorial scale size. 
The loacl scale size of each microburst is computed as 

\begin{equation}
 l_{obs} = T v_D  = T \frac{2 \pi}{\tau_D} (1+ \frac{A}{R_e}) \cos \lambda 
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the time between the first and last bounce observed, $v_D$ is the drift velocity of electrons at magnetic latitude $\lambda$, $A$ is the altitude of SAMPEX at the observation, $R_e$ is the radius of the Earth, and $\tau_D= (60)(62.7)(\frac{MeV}{E})(\frac{1}{L})s$ is the drift period of an electron at an energy $E$ and L-shell $L$. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{scale_hist_local.png}
 \label{fig:local}
 \caption{Local scale size, calculated at SAMPEX's location at time of observation.}
\end{figure}
The resulting distribution of local scale sizes of the microbursts we have collected is presented in \ref{fig:local}.

We can convert the scale size at the location of the observation to the microburst's size at the equator with Gauss' law, setting the flux at SAMPEX's location equal to the flux at the equator:

\begin{equation}
 B_{eq} l_{eq}^2 = B_{obs} l_{obs}^2
\end{equation}
where $B_{eq}$ and $B_{obs}$ are the magnitudes of the magnetic field at the equator and at SAMPEX, and $l_{eq}$ and $l_{obs}$ are the scale sizes of the microburst at the equator and at SAMPEX.

Idealizing Earth's magnetic field as a dipole, we find that the equatorial scale size of the microbursts is 

\begin{equation}
l_{eq} = l_{obs} \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{L R_e}{r_{obs} } \right)^{3/2}
\end{equation}

where $r_{obs}$ is the distance from the center of the Earth to the location of the observation.

 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{log_eq_scales.png}
 \caption{Equatorial azimuthal scale sizes, binned on a logarithmic scale and weighted by bin width.}

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}
***

should have comparison to other papers with estimations of scale size - Mike's FIREBIRD paper, blake 96, others?

what does scale size tell us specifcally about microbursts? size of generation region? 

***

The microbusrts studied here have scale sizes mostly on the order of $10^2$km.
Previous stud(ies?) have found bouncing microbursts with equatorial scale sizes of $530$km \cite{fire_bounce}, others?.
\cite{Blake96} observed that the relative infrequency of bouncing microbursts compared to solitary bursts indicates that most microbursts must have scale sizes of less than a few tens of kilometers, which was the minimum size of microburst that SAMPEX could observe bouncing. 
The bouncing microbursts in this paper therefore represent the population of larger microbursts, not microbursts as a whole.
It can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:log_eq_scales} that the frequency of bouncing microbursts drops off substantially at lower scale sizes, which is as we would expect as SMAPEX is less able to observe bouncing microbursts of smaller scales. 

These scale sizes are similar to the scale sizes of whistler mode chorus waves \cite{chorus_scales}, the primary candidate for the waves that generate microbursts.
