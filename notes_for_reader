Addressing some comments that don't fit nicely into the paper:

I chose wavelets mostly because I thought they were neat, and they aren't the most time intesnive part of my program.
I also had a go with some high pass filters, but scipy's had a tendency to shift the data temporally in a way that 
I couldn't account for. 

As for the cone of influence, it was most often in an area of the wavelet power plot that had been set to zero by the
denoising routine, so I just left it off. 

I fixed the issue with the incorrectly labelled plots.
