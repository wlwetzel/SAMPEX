Process
Took cross correlation between bouncing microburst shaped "kernel" and SAMPEX
data, then verified spots with high correlation by hand. Required that there
was a microburst as defined by the obrien parameter. Chose peaks by hand.

Took average time difference between peaks for each bounce. Calculated bounce
period of 1MeV electrons mirroring at top of atmosphere at SAMPEX's current L.
Divided time diff by bounce period, binned.

Same as above, but with 60keV electrons mirroring at 30deg

Example of four bouncing microbursts in a short time period, two with half
bounce period time differences between peaks and two with whole bounce periods.

L-MLT distribution of bounces with color representing the time diff/bounce period, some outliers were eliminated that were messing with the color gradient.
